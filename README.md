My beginner Arduino projects:


blinkCycle:

Blink cycle varies the interval between the built-in LED flashes on the Arduino UNO. Fast -> slow -> fast.


trafficLightIntersection:

Traffic light intersection project builds on the basic traffic light project by portraying perpendicular lights at an intersection simultaneously.


distanceReader:

Distance Reader uses an ultrasonic sensor to output the distance of an object from the sensor in centimeters. It is accurate within a 2 to 400 centimeter range of the sensor.


speedTracker:

Speed Tracker leverages the distance reader to track the live speed of an object.


dimmableLED:

Dimmable LED utilizes a potentiometer (a voltage divider that can change the resistance allotted to each resistor with a knob) to vary the brightness of an LED.


simpleBuzzModulator:

Simple Buzz Modulator leverages the code from dimmableLED, but uses a buzzer as the output device instead of an LED.


melodyBuzzer:

Melody Buzzer plays a simple melody on a passive buzzer utilizing a pitch library.


lightSwitch:

Light Switch turns an LED on when a push button is pressed.

RGBPicker:

RGB Picker takes the userâ€™s color as input and outputs a preset RGB combination.

pushButtonCounter:

Push-button Counter increments the value on a seven-segment LED display through a button press.

twoButtonCounter:

Two-button Counter allows you to increment or decrement the value on a seven-segment LED display.

nightLight:

Night Light utilizes a photoresistor to adjust the brightness of an LED based on surrounding light levels.

4BitBaseTenToBinary:

This project uses four LEDs to visually display the binary representation of a number (0-15) entered by the user.
