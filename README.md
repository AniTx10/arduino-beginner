My beginner Arduino sketches in chronological order


## blinkCycle:

This project varies the interval between the built-in LED flashes on the Arduino UNO. Fast -> slow -> fast.


## trafficLightIntersection:

This project builds on the basic traffic light project by portraying perpendicular lights at an intersection simultaneously.


## distanceReader:

This project uses an ultrasonic sensor to output the distance of an object from the sensor in centimeters. It is accurate within a 2 to 400 centimeter range of the sensor.


## speedTracker:

This project leverages the distance reader to track the live speed of an object.


## dimmableLED:

This project utilizes a potentiometer (a voltage divider that can change the resistance allotted to each resistor with a knob) to vary the brightness of an LED.


## simpleBuzzModulator:

This project leverages the code from dimmableLED, but uses a buzzer as the output device instead of an LED.


## melodyBuzzer:

This project plays a simple melody on a passive buzzer utilizing a pitch library.


## lightSwitch:

This project turns an LED on when a push button is pressed.


## RGBPicker:

RGB Picker takes the userâ€™s color as input and outputs a preset RGB combination.


## pushButtonCounter:

This project increments the value on a seven-segment LED display through a button press.


## twoButtonCounter:

This project allows you to increment or decrement the value on a seven-segment LED display.


## nightLight:

This project utilizes a photoresistor to adjust the brightness of an LED based on surrounding light levels.


## 4BitBaseTenToBinary:

This project uses four LEDs to visually display the binary representation of a number (0-15) entered by the user.

## servoCycle:

This project rotates a servo motor back and forth 180 degrees in 10 degree increments.

## learnDCMotor:

I learned how to operate a DC motor and used it to power a fan.

## learnShiftRegister:

I learned how to use a  74HC595 shift register to control 8 LEDs with minimal Arduino pins; additionally, it enabled byte-wise data output instead of bit-by-bit control.

## shiftRegisterBinaryDisplay:

This project allows the user to input a byte and displays the byte visually through 8 LEDs.

## learnLogicalShift:

I learned about logical shift left and logical shift right and used the setup from learnShiftRegister to shift left or shift right every second.

## circularShift:

I learned about circular shift left and circular shift right and used the setup from learnShiftRegister to shift left or shift right every second.

## bestCircularShift:

circularShift with improved logic.

## bitFlipper:

This project uses the setup from learnShiftRegister to take the user's byte and visually flip all of its bits using 8 LEDs.

## bitMirror:

This project uses the setup from learnShiftRegister to take the user's byte and visually mirror all of its bits using 8 LEDs.

## learnLCDDisplay:

I learned how to setup and operate a liquid-crystal display.
