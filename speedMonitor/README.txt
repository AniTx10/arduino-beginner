getSpeed():

The speed tracker calls getDistance (distance tracker from the previous project) twice, with a tenth of a second between each function call. 
The delta distance is divided by the tenth of a second to calculate the speed of the object. 

plot():

Speed tracker also utilizes a plot function to format the data given to the serial monitor. 
This allows the program to create a graph of the live distance and speed values.
